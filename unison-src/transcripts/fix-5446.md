Previously `delete.namespace` would refuse to delete a namespace if it would leave any nameless references in `lib`.

```ucm:hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

```unison
lib.one.foo = 17
lib.two.bar = foo Nat.+ foo
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

```ucm
scratch/main> delete.namespace lib.one
```
