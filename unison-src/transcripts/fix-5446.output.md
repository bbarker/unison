  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ‚çü These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      lib.one.foo : Nat
      lib.two.bar : Nat

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ‚çü I've added these definitions:
  
    lib.one.foo : Nat
    lib.two.bar : Nat

scratch/main> delete.namespace lib.one

  ‚ö†Ô∏è
  
  I didn't delete the namespace because the following
  definitions are still in use.
  
  Dependency   Referenced In
  foo          1. lib.two.bar
  
  If you want to proceed anyways and leave those definitions
  without names, use delete.namespace.force
