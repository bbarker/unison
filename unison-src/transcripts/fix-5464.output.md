  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar.baz : Nat
      foo     : Nat
      qux     : Nat

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    bar.baz : Nat
    foo     : Nat
    qux     : Nat

```
``` unison
foo : Nat
foo =
  baz = bar.baz + bar.baz
  20

bar.baz : Nat
bar.baz = 20
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⊡ Previously added definitions will be ignored: bar.baz
    
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      foo : Nat

```
This update should succeed, but it fails because `foo` is incorrectly printed with a `use bar baz` statement, which
causes references to `bar.baz` to be captured by its locally-bound `baz`.

``` ucm
scratch/main> update

  Okay, I'm searching the branch for code that needs to be
  updated...

  That's done. Now I'm making sure everything typechecks...

  Typechecking failed. I've updated your scratch file with the
  definitions that need fixing. Once the file is compiling, try
  `update` again.

```
``` unison :added-by-ucm scratch.u
foo : Nat
foo =
  use Nat +
  use bar baz
  baz = baz + baz
  20

bar.baz : Nat
bar.baz = 20

-- The definitions below no longer typecheck with the changes above.
-- Please fix the errors and try `update` again.

qux : Nat
qux =
  use Nat +
  foo + foo

```
