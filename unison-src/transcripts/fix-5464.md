```ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

```unison
foo : Nat
foo =
  baz = bar.baz + bar.baz
  19

bar.baz : Nat
bar.baz = 20

qux : Nat
qux = foo + foo
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

```unison
foo : Nat
foo =
  baz = bar.baz + bar.baz
  20

bar.baz : Nat
bar.baz = 20
```

This update used to fail because `foo` would incorrectly print with a `use bar baz` statement, which caused references
to `bar.baz` to be captured by its locally-bound `baz`.

```ucm
scratch/main> update
```
