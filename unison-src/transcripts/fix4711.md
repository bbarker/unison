# Delayed Int literal doesn't round trip

``` ucm :hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

``` unison
thisWorks = '(+1)

thisDoesNotWork = ['(+1)]
```

Since this is fixed, `thisDoesNotWork` now does work.

``` ucm
scratch/main> add
scratch/main> edit.new thisWorks thisDoesNotWork
scratch/main> load
```
