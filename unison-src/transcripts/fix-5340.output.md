  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo
      type my.Foo
      lib.dep.lib.dep.foo : Nat
      my.foo              : Nat

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    type lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo
    type my.Foo
    lib.dep.lib.dep.foo : Nat
    my.foo              : Nat

```
These references to type `Foo` and term `foo` should be unambiguous (resolving to the `my.Foo` and `my.foo` in the
file). However, the indirect dependencies `lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo` and `lib.dep.lib.dep.foo` cause them to be ambiguous.

``` unison
type my.Foo = MkFoo
type Bar = MkBar Foo
```

    ❓
    
    I couldn't resolve any of these symbols:
    
        2 | type Bar = MkBar Foo
    
    
    Symbol   Suggestions
             
    Foo      lib.dep.lib.dep.Foo
             my.Foo
  

```
``` unison
my.foo = 17
bar = foo Nat.+ foo
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I couldn't figure out what foo refers to here:
  
      2 | bar = foo Nat.+ foo
  
  The name foo is ambiguous. Its type should be: Nat
  
  I found some terms in scope that have matching names and
  types. Maybe you meant one of these:
  
  my.foo : Nat
  my.foo : Nat
  dep.foo : Nat

```
