  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      one.foo : Nat
      two.foo : Text

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    one.foo : Nat
    two.foo : Text

```
``` unison
one.foo : Nat
one.foo = 18

bar : Nat
bar = foo + foo
```

``` ucm

  I couldn't figure out what foo refers to here:
  
      5 | bar = foo + foo
  
  The name foo is ambiguous. Its type should be: Nat
  
  I found some terms in scope that have matching names and
  types. Maybe you meant one of these:
  
  one.foo : Nat
  one.foo : Nat

```
