This transcripts demonstrates that pattern matching on a "constructor" (defined as a variable that begins with a capital
letter) that is either not found or ambiguouus fails. Previously, it would be treated as a variable binding.

```ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge
```

```unison:error
type Foo = Bar Nat

foo : Foo -> Nat
foo = cases
    Bar X -> 5
```

```unison:error
type Foo = Bar A
type A = X
type B = X

foo : Foo -> Nat
foo = cases
    Bar X -> 5
```
