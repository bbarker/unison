This transcripts demonstrates that pattern matching on a "constructor" (defined as a variable that begins with a capital
letter) that is either not found or ambiguouus fails. Previously, it would be treated as a variable binding.

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge

  Done.

```
``` unison
type Foo = Bar Nat

foo : Foo -> Nat
foo = cases
    Bar X -> 5
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I don't know about any data constructor named X. Maybe make
  sure it's correctly spelled and that you've imported it:
  
      5 |     Bar X -> 5
  

```
``` unison
type Foo = Bar A
type A = X
type B = X

foo : Foo -> Nat
foo = cases
    Bar X -> 5
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I don't know about any data constructor named X. Maybe make
  sure it's correctly spelled and that you've imported it:
  
      7 |     Bar X -> 5
  

```
