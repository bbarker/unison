  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you

scratch/main> branch foo

  Done. I've created the foo branch based off of main.
  
  Tip: To merge your work back into the main branch, first
       `switch /main` then `merge /foo`.

scratch/main> merge /foo

  I merged scratch/foo into scratch/main.

```
``` 
main
|
|           bar
|           |
F - D - C - B - A
 \             /
  ----------- E
              |
              foo
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> merge /bar

  I couldn't automatically merge scratch/bar into scratch/main.
  However, I've added the definitions that need attention to the
  top of scratch.u.
  
  When you're done, you can run
  
    merge.commit
  
  to merge your changes back into main and delete the temporary
  branch. Or, if you decide to cancel the merge instead, you can
  run
  
    delete.branch /merge-bar-into-main
  
  to delete the temporary branch and switch back to main.

```
``` unison:added-by-ucm scratch.u
-- scratch/main
x : Nat
x = 4

-- scratch/bar
x : Nat
x = 2

```

This should be a fast-forward, but we get this shape instead (which fails due to conflicts), because we incorrectly
compute `LCA(main, bar)` as `A`, not `B`.

``` 
main
|
|  ------------ bar
| /            \|
G - F - D - C - B - A
     \             /
      ----------- E
                  |
                  foo
```
