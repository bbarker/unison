Below is an example of variable capture occuring from pattern matching.

```unison

foo w = match (5, w) with
  x ->
    y = toText x
    match 99 with _ -> ()
    z = toText x
    (y,z)

> foo 8
```

Arguably, the root cause is flattening of nested lets like this one.

```unison

bar x =
  -- argument here
  y = Debug.toText x
  let
    x = 5
    ()
  -- 5 here, before fix
  z = Debug.toText x
  (y, z)

> bar 3
```
