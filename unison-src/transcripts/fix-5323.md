This transcript demonstrates that dependents of an upgrade are suffixified properly. Previously, `c = b.y + 1` would
render as `c = y + 1` (ambiguous).

``` ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

``` unison
lib.old.x = 17
lib.new.x = 100

a.y = 18
b.y = lib.old.x + 1

c = b.y + 1
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> add
```

``` ucm
scratch/main> upgrade old new
```
