`namespace` + top level `use` should work. Previously, they didn't.

``` unison
namespace foo
use bar baz
x = 10
```

``` ucm

  Loading changes detected in scratch.u.

  I got confused here:
  
      2 | use bar baz
  
  
  I was surprised to find a 'use' here.
  I was expecting one of these instead:
  
  * ability
  * bang
  * binding
  * do
  * false
  * force
  * handle
  * if
  * lambda
  * let
  * quote
  * termLink
  * true
  * tuple
  * type
  * typeLink

```
