This transcript demonstrates that dependents of an update are suffixified properly. Previously, `c = b.y + 1` would
render as `c = y + 1` (ambiguous).

```ucm
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

```unison
x = 17

a.y = 18
b.y = x + 1

c = b.y + 1
```

```ucm
scratch/main> add
```

```unison
x = 100
```

```ucm
scratch/main> update
```
