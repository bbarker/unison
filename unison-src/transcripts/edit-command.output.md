  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      bar    : Nat
      foo    : Nat
      mytest : [Result]

```
``` ucm
scratch/main> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    bar    : Nat
    foo    : Nat
    mytest : [Result]

scratch/main> edit foo bar

  ☝️
  
  I added 2 definitions to the top of scratch.u
  
  You can edit them there, then run `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

scratch/main> edit mytest

  ☝️
  
  I added 1 definitions to the top of scratch.u

    missing

# `edit2`

The `edit2` command adds to the current fold, and takes care not to add definitions that are already in the file.

This stanza does nothing for some reason (transcript runner bug?), so we repeat it twice.

``` unison
foo = 17
bar = 18
baz = 19
```

``` ucm
