```unison
foo = 4

bar = 5
```

`alias.many` should be able to consume the numbered args produced by `ls`. Previously, `ls` would produce absolute paths, but `alias.many` required relative ones.

Now `ls` returns a pair of the absolute search directory and the result relative to that search directory, so it can be used in both absolute and relative contexts.

```ucm
scratch/main> add
scratch/main> ls
scratch/main> alias.many 1-2 .ns1_nohistory
```
