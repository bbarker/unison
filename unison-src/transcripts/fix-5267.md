```ucm:hide
scratch/main> builtins.merge lib.builtin
```

```unison
lib.direct.foo : Nat
lib.direct.foo = 17

lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo : Nat
lib.direct.lib.indirect.foo = 18

bar : Nat
bar = direct.foo + direct.foo
```

Here, `bar` renders as `foo + foo`, even though there are two names with suffix `foo` in scope, because one is an
indirect dependency. It used to render as `direct.foo + direct.foo`.

```ucm
scratch/main> add
scratch/main> view bar
```
