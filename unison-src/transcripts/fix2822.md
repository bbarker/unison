# Inability to reference a term or type with a name that has segments starting with an underscore

```ucm:hide
scratch/main> builtins.mergeio
```

There should be no issue having terms with an underscore-led component

```unison
_a.blah = 2

b = _a.blah + 1
```

Or even that _are_ a single “blank” component

```unison
_b = 2

x = _b + 1
```
Types can also have underscore-led components.

```unison
unique type _a.Blah = A

c : _a.Blah
c = A
```

And we should also be able to access underscore-led fields.

```unison
type Hello = {_value : Nat}

doStuff = _value.modify
```

But pattern matching shouldn’t bind to underscore-led names.

```unison:error
dontMap f = cases
  None -> false
  Some _used -> f _used
```

But we can use them as unbound patterns.

```unison
dontMap f = cases
  None -> false
  Some _unused -> f 2
```
